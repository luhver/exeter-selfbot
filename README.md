Updated exeter selfbot, what i did is changed help cmd, and gifs to anime, i fixed embeds ex: the kiss, hug, and those cmds yk
u can run this on replit.com (copy the link of this repo, go to repl, click the +, choose import from github, paste the link, it should start saying "detecting language & cloning git" when its done on the side there should be "language", choose python, you're done now, all u gotta do is, delete those files, .replit, .gitignore, README.md, you should run the repl now and have fun)
pc users just download this, remove first 2 lines in main.py, delete keep_alive.py
